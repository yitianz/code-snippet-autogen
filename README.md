# code-snippet-autogen

In order to improve developer speed and productivity, we are creating an IDE extension that allows users to generate code snippets automatically based on plain English phrases.

For example, a developer who wants to use binary search as a subroutine for her task can simply use the following command snip.getCodeSnippet("binary search") to generate a code template for generic binary search in her programming language of choice.

## Features

## Examples of Autogenerated Code Snippets

## Members
* Yitian
* Kripa
* Vinay
* Raju

## Programming Languages Supported
* Python
* Java
* C/C++
* Javascript

## Technologies Used
* React (Frontend)
* Java / Spring Boot (Backend)
* VSCode <-- other IDE?
* Postgres / NoSQL <-- choose?
* Heroku / AWS / GCP / Azure <-- which hosting?
* Javascript for browser version that works for Leetcode / Hackerrank and other browser dev environments

## MEETING 9/11

TECH
* Java, Spring Boot
* Postgres, NoSQL DB
* Heroku -> GCP / AWS

TODO
* 1. Do research on code generation -- find papers, code repos, etc.*
2. User workflow diagram
3. Design system architecture
4. Build a small library of {word => code snippets} for testing purposes
5. Integrate with VSCode as IDE extension 
6. Make it work for more programming languages
7. Possibly have NLP to parse the input words
